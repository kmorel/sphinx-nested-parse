Trying out a basic extension
==============================

Here is the box created by writing out the directive explicitly.

.. admonition:: Fun Fact

   You don't have to waste money on expensive binoculars. If you want
   something to appear bigger, just get closer.


Here is the same box except using the directive provided by our simple
extension.

.. funfact::

   You don't have to waste money on expensive binoculars. If you want
   something to appear bigger, just get closer.


As a second example, let's do a DOI lookup. Here is the link written out
explicitly: `doi:10.1007/978-3-319-20119-1_34 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20119-1_34>`_.


Here is the same link using an easier role:
:doi:`10.1007/978-3-319-20119-1_34`.
